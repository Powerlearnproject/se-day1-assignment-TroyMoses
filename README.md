Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software products with systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools.

- Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that enhance and streamline various aspects of life e.g entertainment, commerce, communication etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages like the C programming language.
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. **Requirements gathering:** Involves collecting and documenting both user and system requirements.
2. **Design:** Involves creating detailed designs or blueprints of how the software will look like and the user interfaces too.
3. **Implementation:** Involves a group of developers writing code and building the software as specified in the design process.
4. **Testing:** Involves ensuring that the software meets quality standards and the functional requirements have been met by applying various types of testing.
5. **Deployment:** Involves releasing the software to users or customers by installing it or launching it to the specified customers' machines or computers.
6. **Maintenance:** Involves regular or occassional support provided after the deployment phase to ensure that the software runs smoothly and efficiently, providing updates where neccessary.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- The waterfall methodology follows a strict linear and sequential progression of phases(requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance) and each phase must be completed before the next one begins.
- The waterfall methodology would be appropriate in projects with well-defined requirements, strict deadlines and budgets, and also where documentation is critical. For example developing a core banking system, a software that controls medical machines e.g MRI machines since these systems have strict and well defined requirements and documentation

- The agile methodology involves an iterative and incremental approach usually focusing on flexibility, response to change and collaboration. For example building an e-commerce website where user needs and requirements oftenly change rapidly, creating a mobile application where the user preferences evolve quickly etc.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. **Software Developer:** Writes code and ensures its implementation is okay.
2. **Quality Assurance Engineer:** Ensures that the software product meets the set quality standards using various tests.
3. **Project Manager:** Responsible for overseeing the whole software processes from planning to the delivery of the product.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code therefore increasing productivity, reducing errors etc. Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio Code, IntelliJIDEA, Eclipse.
- VCS help in tracking changes to source code and also coordinating work among team members. Examples of VCS are Git, GitHub, GitLab.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- **Rapid tech advancement:** Software engineers must constantly learn new tech stacks inorder to stay updated. Strategies include embracing constant learning, staying updated with company news.
- **Tight deadlines:** Software engineers are oftenly pressurized to deliver software products on schedule. Strategies include applying agile methodologies and prioritizing tasks.
- **Technical debts:** Shortcuts taken during development can accumulate into technical debt, making it harder to maintain and update the codebase. Strategies include focusing on code quality, always refactoring code etc.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. **Unit testing:** Involves testing individual components and units of the software in isolation. This helps identify errors earlier in production, ensures that individual components are functional and thus more reliable.
2. **Integration testing:** Involves testing the interactivity between the various units of the software. Helps to identify whether integrated components work together correctly.
3. **System testing:** Involves testing the complete, integrated system as a whole. This ensures that the system meets all the functional and non-functional requirements.
4. **Acceptance testing:** This testing is performed by the end-users or customers to ensure that the system meets the business requirements and is acceptable to be used.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the creation and optimization of text inputs or prompts that guide AI models to generate accurate and relevant responses.
- Prompt engineering helps to improve the quality of AI-generated content, ensuring it aligns with the user's intent.
- It gives the users great control over the AI's behaviour, allowing them to steer the model towards specific outputs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- **Vague Prompt:** "Write something about cats."
- **Improved Prompt:** "Write a short, fictional story (approximately 150 words) about a Persian cat who believes he is a royal king and demands daily allegiance."
- **Why improved prompt is more effective:**
1. It is clear and specific.
2. It is concise.
3. It has a context.
